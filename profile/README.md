## Hi there 👋

* 🙋‍♀️ This is the GPC or Grails Plugin Collective. A place for Grails plugins.
* 🌈 The life of these plugins are greatly dependent on the contributions from the community. Any pull-request, bug-report og feature-request are taken into consideration.
* 🧙 Remember, this is a community effort. No plugin here can survive without active involvment from the community. 


See https://github.com/gpc/release-demo for instructions on how to structure your project to make it ready for The Grails Plugin Collective.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
